# StudentPrediction
The product is a simple web site which takes three user inputs( marks of previous three semester in 100) and displays a linear graph of the studentâ€™s performance over the previous semesters. The graph provides a quick overview of the student. The model also predicts whether the student is likely to pass or fail the current examination.
